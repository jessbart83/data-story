      <h2>So What's the Big Deal Anyways?</h2>
      <section>
"Okay..so what," I thought, sitting in my Writing and Digital Media Class
for the third time of my college career; I never thought of myself as a very technical person,
and the thought of data brought images of endless lists of numbers and figures that bored me to tears.
I mostly saw data intersecting in my life through the way I received information; I have the CNN app
as well as other social media accounts that keep me up to date. Right off the bat, the Dear Data
project looked really cool--honestly, I didn’t one hundred percent understand what kind of data they
were collecting, but I liked the visual representation on the postcards; this interesting introduction
brought continous discovery and development throughout the different projects we created throughout <thead>
semester But before we even got started on the Dear Data project, we had to understand the ethics of expediency understand
deliberate rhetoric. According to Steven Katz, some basic definitions of ethos include “stable both in individual life and in a community”/
“a character trait, a personal quality that is reliant and persistent.” My train of though followed the
latter--I personally believe that ethos is an ethical representation of something. From what I gathered from Katz’s
argument was that ethics of expediency are deliberate rhetoric choices that the writer makes to dehumanize a subject.

So how do Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec fit into this equation of ethical expediency? These two data enthusiasts
recorded different aspects about their lives each week for an entire year; this allowed them to notice that even the most
obscure things can be classified as data. For my project, I recorded my Spotify playlist listening habits. Over the course of
a week, I recorded all of the different times I listened to a different playlist--it was incredibly tedious, but I was also able to notice
some interesting factors, like which playlists I would play around certain people, and even what kind of music I listened to when
I was by myself.

This particular project taught me patience if anything else, as I was often getting confused and frustrated with the program
we were using: Inkscape. I felt as though the project was so tedious, and it took hours and hours of constantly readjusting or rearranging the objects
that I even started to hate what I was trying to chart out (my aforementioned Spotify playlist listening habits). Halfway through, I threw away my original idea
of having a relational chart just because it was difficult to convey the relationships between the playlists and also because categorical was a cleaner,
more comprehensible look in my opinion. It did show me, however, how meticulous and minute data can be, and as someone who collects
it, I want to display my data as best I can, so I often got frustrated at the small mistakes I was making.

    <h2>Explained Video</h2>

This was probably the most eye-opening among all the research I've come across this semester: my group focused on how healthcare algorithms
create biases towards people with preexisting health conditions, and I found that it’s much more unfair than I originally expected. People with preexisting
conditions have either higher premiums than people who don’t (as the insurance companies see them as liabilities and prone to costing them money) or they’re
rejected. This proves to border the unethical as more and more people try to receive insurance and the algorithms view them only as a set of data that matches
or doesn’t match the mold for their ideal customers. In addition, we were also learning how to contruct a video, and all the jargon that went along with it.
In a very real sense, learning video editing jargon helped us get a better grip on how we want to display our video, and allowed us to get a look at how viedographers
make their own videoes that aim to capitivate audiences. It was interesting and fun to work with other people who were also finding the topic as fascinating as I was!

To round the semester out, we were instructed on how to build a website through the coding generator Atom and computer markup such as HTML and CSS. Bringing together
all the different aspects of the course, building this website has been the culmination of tying all the pieces together. By learning how to craft my own webpage, I've found a new
kind of respect and understanding for computer engineers everywhere (as well as fellow ENGL 3844 student :')

    <h2>Journal of Learning</h2>

    <section>
  Throughout the semeseter, we kept track of what we were doing each week through the use of a Journal of Learning--a way for each of us to
  record the unique ways we were perceiving the information as we were covering the different topics in class. The purpose of the assignment was
  to keeping up with the assignments and readings by summarizing them in our own words. I really like the idea, even though I found myself slacking
  more than I had wanted. Nevertheless, the journal gave me a place to get all my thoughts down in one place about certain topics explained in class.
  It's definitely a clever learning technique, one I hope to participate better in next time in the future.
